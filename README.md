# Communication-Relay-using-Wifi-Mesh
Communication Relay by creating a WiFi Mesh Network using ROS, and using that network for Data Telemetry, with Telemetry radios ( Ubiquiti Bullet, Ubiquiti Nanostation) being used as Access Points and Base stations. These are mounted on Drones (with provision for Autopilot using PixHawk modules) so as to facilitate large scale operations at remote locations, accompanied with an Android App.
